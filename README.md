Introduction- Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!

Scenario- You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Business Objective: To maximize the number of annual memberships by converting casual riders to annual members.

Section 1-Ask
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships
How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Section 2-Prepare
The dataset required for this business objective is of the past 9 months. Here, we are considering data from Oct 2021 to June 2022.

Dataset available at - https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

The data was made available by Motivate International Inc. under the appropriate license which ensures credibility of the data. This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.

I downloaded the csv files as per the requirement and stored it in a single folder so they are easier to access and work on.

Section 3-Process & Analyze
I am using Python language for working on data as it is more appropriate for working with large dataset i.e. 35,17476 rows.
Data processing and analysis is done in jupyter notebook.

Observations-
On average, casual riders ride longer than member riders.
Casual riders take more rides on the weekend than member riders.
members have a bigger proportion of the dataset.
Top 3 Stations for casual and member riders: - Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Wells St & Concord Ln.
This could be useful for making recommendations for a targeted marketing campaign to convert casual riders to member riders.
Also this could be useful for rewarding member riders with special discounts if any.
Member have peak periods which is at 9 a.m and 6 p.m indicate that they are most likely office workers. The casual rider peak period is 6 p.m.
Only casual riders use docked bikes, so we can offer special incentives in order to increase conversion from casual to member.
