Introduction- Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!

Scenario- You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Business Objective: To maximize the number of annual memberships by converting casual riders to annual members.

Section 1-Ask

How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships

How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Section 2-Prepare

The dataset required for this business objective is of the past 12 months. Here, we are considering data of past 9 months from Oct 2021 to June 2022, because Tableau public doesn't allow files larger than 1GB.

Dataset available at - https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

The data was made available by Motivate International Inc. under the appropriate license which ensures credibility of the data. This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.

I downloaded the csv files as per the requirement and stored it in a single folder so they are easier to access and work on.

Section 3-Process & Analyze

I am using Python language for working on data as it is more appropriate for working with large dataset i.e. 35,17476 rows.

Data processing and analysis is done in jupyter notebook.

Section 5-Act

Observations-

On average, casual riders ride longer than member riders.

Casual riders take more rides on the weekend than member riders.

Top 3 Stations for casual and member riders: - Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St, Wells St & Concord Ln.

Member have peak periods which is at 9 a.m and 6 p.m indicate that they are most likely office workers. The casual rider peak period is 6 p.m.

Docked bikes are mostly used by casual riders.

Final Conclusion-

The above observations could be useful for making recommendations for a targeted marketing campaign to convert casual riders to member riders.
Cyclistic could partner with restaurants and recreational facilities near the Top 3 start stations. As an example a discounted bike share membership could be offered when they purchase an item at a local business near these stations.
The best would be if the marketing team can run a survey to collect the data from current casual riders, understand what kind of features or benefits they look for when considering membership.
